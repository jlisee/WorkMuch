About
-----

This is a simple tool that uses the X windows system to record which program
you are currently using and it's title bar.  It can do this at a high rate so
you can analyze the results and get accurate reporting on what you actually 
use your computer for.


Dependencies
------------

python-xlib is used to interact with X11, and libX11 and libXss directly 
through ctypes.  You can install these on ubuntu using::

    sudo apt-get install python-xlib libX11-dev libXss-dev


Usage
-----

Just run the pytime.py program (use --help to see the options) and it will
record data into the ~/.workmuch directory.
